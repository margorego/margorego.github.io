                <p>My name is Margo Rego and I'm a designer-to-be from Southcoast Massachusetts. 
                I am currently a sophomore studing Graphic Design at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. 
                I find my inspiration in colors, patterns, and the outdoors. 
                My goal in life is to work for a meaningful company to make modern graphics and designs for them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Other than graphic design, my life revolves around the outdoors. I am very passionate about rock climbing, hiking, and sustainability.
                I have been climbing since I was 15, and have never looked back. The amazingly supportive and passionate people I have met through climbing
                help to inspire me to be a better designer and create work I am passionate about. Climbing has taken me throughout the United States and I am
                so greatful to say I am truly living my best life.
